    <h1 nz-typography>What is this?</h1>

    <p nz-typography>
      Viewers can watch videos together with other connected viewers in
      viewer-maintained channels.
    <br>
      Video content can be added from different video hosts (e.g., YouTube,
      Twitch) and the playback is synchronized for all the viewers in the
      channel.
    </p>
    <p nz-typography>
      Each channel has a chat feed for discussion and a playlist where users can
      queue up videos to play.
    </p>

    <p nz-typography>
      Currently only logged in users can enter channels and watch content but
      that may change in the future.
    </p>

    <p nz-typography>
      This project is intended to be open sourced once I deem it stable enough
      to release to the public.
