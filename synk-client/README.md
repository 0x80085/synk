## Installation

Run `yarn` in this folder.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` or `npm start` for a dev server.

Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

By default, it will try to connect to the API at location `localhost:3000`, change this in the `environment.ts` file

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

Use the `--prod` flag for a production build. By default, it will use the `environment.prod.ts` file when building for production.
